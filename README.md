My project is about shoes for Adidas. It is for those people who love Adidas shoes. But it is only to browse through the shoes.

For my website will be whole in one, all the pages will be in one page. But all are divided into sections. It have Home page, About page, Shop Page and Contact Us page.

At the start of making this website, i was thinking a very simple website because i not very good at creating website. But for designing i am ok with it. I have to keep looking through sample and learn how to create a website.

The design of the website is very simple and easy use. It just a banner for the home page. About us will just have text of what the shop site is about. The shop page will have sliding images and prices and details of the shoes. And lastly the contact us page will have a form to fill up their name, email and subject to write about, and have a map to show where the store is located at.


The things i used to create this website are HTML, CSS and Javascript.
